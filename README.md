# Hour of Code

As a challenge to myself and my friends, I have committed to 100 days of coding for an hour. Here is a log of my day by day and the progress I make:


### Day 11 2/14/23

Finished up my vocal math program, may need to expand the database if it was going to go into something real. Think my next project should be some varations of chess rather than an app. Will check working on this later.

### Day 10 2/13/23

Missed another day. But today kept working on the app. Mostly just following along with a guide on how to make users login. Think I actually might just skip to the backend. I really don't like front end work, and swift, although it may not be, just feels so messy to me. 

### Day 9 2/11/23

No commits on this repo today. I was doing some researching about what would be a good project to develop next. I think I am going to try to make an app. This will probably end up being full stack, but I am exicted to start working on it and getting past problems along the way. Instead for today see the connections repo for day 9. Yet, you will not find a lot of work quite yet.

### Day 8 2/10/23

Missed a day, however, I am back on. Think I am nearing the end of this project. The rest would be to expand the database and my outputs cleaner. Yet, if I were to talk to this program, I would feel confident putting it in desmos. Although, one fault is that the parentheses need to be explictly spoken to the program. Working on making a system warning the user if they do not have enough parentheses, but there is just no way to read the user's mind to place them.

### Day 7 2/8/23

The parathesis are killing me. Need to make sure that cosine of cosine of cosine of cosine of cosine of minus 2 is going to equal cos (cos(cos(cos(cos(cos(-2))))))

### Day 6 2/7/23

More processing work, sucesses today (although some M1-chip nonsense). Found a solution from my problem yesterday, if the word is an english word, do not let it in. Hopefully this will prevent the "uhhh"s from being read as u * h^3. Will need to do some more testing and some more filtering work I bet.

### Day 5 2/6/23

Worked some more on processing. An issue with filtering "math language" from normal language. I think one solution is numbers or single charaters pass. However, if and only if the word can be split into "nums then string" then pass. However I am still a little lost on how to deciver words like "to" from a math equation "xz". I think I might have to some charaters that can be filtered to. That was today, but then tried to help my friend with some leet code problems. I only got so far and then had to turn to homework.

### Day 4 2/5/23

Worked on a small side project to brute force a math assignment. Other than that, data entry for the dictonary and more processing work.

### Day 3 2/4/23

Worked on the function to process the words. Some fun problems today. If the speech comes back as "arc cosine", then a simple word by word process would process "arc" as nothing, and "cosine" as cos. So rather, further fit needs to be made. So now, the program reaches about 5 words ahead, and reports back the best fit. Although, a little worried about how many edge cases there is going to be because of how many math symbols there are.

### Day 2 2/3/23

Today I am pulling my hair out. Trying to get the audio part of this audio program is the worst. I have two main issues, I am on Mac and I am on the M1 chip. God knows if I knew I was going to run into this much trouble with coding, I would have gotten a windows. This might be a project more sittuted to a windows computer. Instead, I switched my focus to the processing of the audio, the part I was looking forward to as a fun promblem.

### Day 1 2/2/23

Rocky start, I first looked into author attribution machine learning models. Yet, in a want for simplicity, I changed to a vocal math program. Where you read out your math equations and the computer types it. Downloaded and used a speech recognizer, then thought I probably should built it in Java. I do not want to build it in Java anymore.
