# Hour of Code

As a challenge to myself and my friends, I have committed to 100 days of coding for an hour. Here is a log of my day by day and the progress I make:


### Day 3 2/4/23

Worked on the function to process the words. Some fun problems today. If the speech comes back as "arc cosine", then a simple word by word process would process "arc" as nothing, and "cosine" as cos instead. So rather, the furthers fit needs to be made. So now, the program reaches about 5 words ahead, and reports back the best fit. A little worried about how many edge cases there is going to be because of how many math symbols there are.

### Day 2/3/23

Today I am pulling my hair out. Trying to get the audio part of this audio program is the worst. I have two main issues, I am on Mac and I am on the M1 chip. God knows if I knew I was going to run into this much trouble with coding, I would have gotten a windows. This might be a project more sittuted to a windows computer. Instead, I switched my focus to the processing of the audio, the part I was looking forward to as a fun promblem

### Day 1 2/2/23

Rocky start, I first looked into author attribution machine learning models. Yet, in a want for simplicity, I changed to a vocal math program. Where you read out your math equations and the computer types it. Downloaded and used a speech recognizer, then thought I probably should built it in Java. I do not want to build it in Java anymore.
