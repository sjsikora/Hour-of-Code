# Hour of Code

As a challenge to myself and my friends, I have committed to 100 days of coding for an hour. Here is a log of my day by day and the progress I make:

### Day 7 2/8/23

The parathesis are killing me. Need to make sure that cosine of cosine of cosine of cosine of cosine of minus 2 is going to equal cos (cos(cos(cos(cos(cos(-2))))))

### Day 6 2/7/23

More processing work, sucesses today (although some M1-chip nonsense). Found a solution from my problem yesterday, if the word is an english word, do not let it in. Hopefully this will prevent the "uhhh"s from being read as u * h^3. Will need to do some more testing and some more filtering work I bet.

### Day 5 2/6/23

Worked some more on processing. An issue with filtering "math language" from normal language. I think one solution is numbers or single charaters pass. However, if and only if the word can be split into "nums then string" then pass. However I am still a little lost on how to deciver words like "to" from a math equation "xz". I think I might have to some charaters that can be filtered to. That was today, but then tried to help my friend with some leet code problems. I only got so far and then had to turn to homework.

### Day 4 2/5/23

Worked on a small side project to brute force a math assignment. Other than that, data entry for the dictonary and more processing work.

### Day 3 2/4/23

Worked on the function to process the words. Some fun problems today. If the speech comes back as "arc cosine", then a simple word by word process would process "arc" as nothing, and "cosine" as cos. So rather, further fit needs to be made. So now, the program reaches about 5 words ahead, and reports back the best fit. Although, a little worried about how many edge cases there is going to be because of how many math symbols there are.

### Day 2/3/23

Today I am pulling my hair out. Trying to get the audio part of this audio program is the worst. I have two main issues, I am on Mac and I am on the M1 chip. God knows if I knew I was going to run into this much trouble with coding, I would have gotten a windows. This might be a project more sittuted to a windows computer. Instead, I switched my focus to the processing of the audio, the part I was looking forward to as a fun promblem.

### Day 1 2/2/23

Rocky start, I first looked into author attribution machine learning models. Yet, in a want for simplicity, I changed to a vocal math program. Where you read out your math equations and the computer types it. Downloaded and used a speech recognizer, then thought I probably should built it in Java. I do not want to build it in Java anymore.
